# Fansite created with HTML and CSS

A basic BTS fansite showcasing frontend web development 

Web pages:
1. Index page - Description about the group and members along with their fanclub.
2. Gallery page - a captivating gallery page showing pictures of the group
3. Awards and achievements page - showing a glimpse of their remarkable journey and some of their awards and achievements

This website holds the memories of my early web development journey, a simple creation which I was really excited for.
And this also reminds me of my "phase" of being a fangirl, good that I'm over it now ;)
