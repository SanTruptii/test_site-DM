            <p class="info">ARMY or A.R.M.Y (아미) is BTS's official fandom name. It was officially established
                on July 9, 2013 after the first recruitment closed.
                "A.R.M.Y" stands for "Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth" and it carries quite some
                meaning behind it, given that "Army" is associated with the military, body armor, and how
                those two things are always together, the fandom name basically means that fans will always be
                together with BTS. BTS and A.R.M.Y are almost mirrored mages of each other and they have a
                relationship that is affected by each other. The symbol of A.R.M.Y is expressed as a door on
                their viewpoint who is waiting & welcoming BTS on the opposite door when BTS opens a new door.
